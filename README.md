## Quick Information

This is a firmware for reprap single-processor electronics setups, but this particular fork is specifically suited for [BQ printers](http://bq.com/3d-world). 

Based on [Marlin](https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin), from Erik Zalm, this firmware is a mashup between [Sprinter](https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter), [grbl](https://github.com/simen/grbl) and many original parts.

## Licence

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](Documentation/COPYING.md) because I believe in open development.
Please do not use this code in products (3D printers, CNC etc) that are closed source or are crippled by a patent.
